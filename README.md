# Palestinian Regional Accent Recognition System 🗣️🔎

This project involves developing and evaluating a simple acoustic Palestinian regional accent recognition system. Palestinian accents have many different sub-accents such as Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, and Ramallah. The goal is to develop a system that can recognize the accent of a speaker from these four accents based on a short speech segment. The system will be based on acoustic features extracted from speech for accent recognition.
