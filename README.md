# Palestinian Regional Accent Recognition System üó£Ô∏èüîé

This project involves developing and evaluating a simple acoustic Palestinian regional accent recognition system. Palestinian accents have many different sub-accents such as Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, and Ramallah. The goal is to develop a system that can recognize the accent of a speaker from these four accents based on a short speech segment. The system will be based on acoustic features extracted from speech for accent recognition.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a Recognition System: Create a system capable of recognizing the accent of a speaker out of the four Palestinian accents mentioned above.
2. Acoustic Feature Extraction: Utilize acoustic features extracted from speech to perform accent recognition.
3. Accent Classification: Implement and evaluate different classification models to accurately identify the accent from a short speech segment.

## Accent Classes

1. Jerusalem
2. Nablus
3. Hebron
4. Ramallah
